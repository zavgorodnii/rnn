"I joined a new league this year and they have different scoring rules than I'm used to. It's a slight PPR league- .2 PPR. Standard besides 1 points for 15 yards receiving, .2 points per completion, 6 points per TD thrown, and some bonuses for rec/rush/pass yardage. My question is, is it wildly clear that QB has the highest potential for points? I put in the rules at a ranking site and noticed that top QBs had 300 points more than the top RB/WR. Would it be dumb not to grab a QB in the first round?"
"In your scenario, a person could just not run the mandatory background check on the buyer and still sell the gun to the felon. There's no way to enforce it. An honest seller is going to not sell the gun to them when they see they're a felon on the background check. A dishonest seller isn't going to run the check in the first place. No one is going to be honest enough to run the check, see they're a felon, and then all of a sudden immediately turn dishonest and say ""nah, you know what, here's your gun anyway."" They wouldn't run the fucking check in the first place, genius. Your bullshit proposal is **NOT ENFORCEABLE**. This is why people without 

&gt;Here's an idea, why not make a background check system where it would be illegal to sell guns to felons? That doesn't convince you? IDGAF.

We already fucking have that. What aren't you understanding about this?! It's just currently not available to private sellers. I'd like to make it available, but there's no point in making it mandatory.

&gt;You're just supporting it to make a gesture towards background check reform in bad faith.

As a gun owner who has harmed no one and has constitutionally protected rights, I actually don't own the anti-gun side a damn thing. It's people like you that convince me to not give an inch at all. I'm wiling to extend NICS to private sellers as voluntary. Take it or leave it, because it isn't going to be made mandatory. Not gonna happen. Period."

"I dunno, back before the August update in an A+ lobby for Tower Control in Saltspray Rig, I remember the enemy team barraging us with bombs in a suspiciously coordinated fashion.  And my teammates were also tossing bombs left and right.  Non-stop splat/suction/burst bombs.  Bombs, bombs fucking everywhere.  It was terrifying having to dodge one after the other.  It never ended, and some of them even had bomb rush to toss even more goddamn bombs.

I think I still have PTSD of that horrifying event.  That match really felt like a Michael Bay movie."

"Implement some form of tenure for mods and require a majority vote to remove any tenured mod. Only allow mods to trigger a removal vote on mods lower than them in the hierarchy however.

This removes the possibility of a single mod (such as an absentee top mod) swooping in and blowing up the sub but doesn't create opportunities for hijacking. Importantly, it also doesn't require rejiggering the existing mod hierarchies or ongoing admin involvement in dispute resolution."

"I think you might be missing my point. A gun is a tool which allows you to kill very efficiently. Not having those around means there's less chance for people to make dumb decisions which end up in deaths. I'm not concerned with spree killers or other people who plan to kill, I'm concerned with people who wouldn't otherwise put other's lives at risk when they get angry, but there's a gun at hand. The latter is vastly more common than the former."

"Im Dutch and have watched all Netherlands games for the last few years, Nigel de Jong has been solid during the WC and before and I see no reason at all not to include him since we don't have any non attacking midfielders in our team other then Anita (which I don't really rate) and Blind (who we'll probably need as LB). Tete hasn't even been that good in the eredivisie IMO, so why put him ahead of a expierenced player in the Dutch squad like Janmaat is beyond me.  We don't have a real LB in the squad, only Blind and Kongolo (who didn't play well in a weak eredivisie last season) so that's why I would include Pieters.
   I'm not making assumptions here. I agree that our defense hasn't been that good, that's why I don't get why we don't use Nigel de Jong, that's why I wouldn't use young unexpierenced players like Riedewald and Tete. These matches are super important, we won't qualify if we don't win them, so if you want to experiment with other players I would always use more expierenced players and not players who played with each other before instead of new ones like Tete, Riedewald and Anita.

&gt; But the appeals court reasoned that, “Constable Webb had entered Cupello’s apartment without consent, probable cause, reasonable suspicion, or exigent circumstances. Because Constable Webb resisted Cupello’s subsequent attempts to close the door, Cupello had a reasonable belief that force was necessary to terminate Constable Webb’s unlawful entry into his apartment.”"

"I think *M* is one of the most interesting early sound films. Fritz Lang really made incredible use of sound, especially for a director who had predominantly done silent films at the time. Much of the film is completely silent which adds to the suspense for me and the anxiety that the film creates. There's never really a wasted sound clip, every line of dialogue is extremely important. Even Peter Lorre's whistling is integral to the plot."

I prefer summons since they actually do really decent damage and clear maps very well if you have an acceptable range. Therefore, Murgoth is probably the best summoned soul or magnificent Magnus (which is also a summon). Prefixes usually determine what type of stat they will have. So for example A **clever** ""soul"" will provide the int stat or a **potent** ""soul"" will provide attack damage. Specifically for a xenon you probably want a **flashy** soul since it gives an all stats boost if you can't manage to find/buy a magnificent soul."

In terms of which of those is the most fun to level, for the average person its probably going to be grappler. Striker does not really become fun until you get lightning dance at level 40, and nen is probably going to be completely boring to you until you get a bunch of cube skills (what this will mean to you is different per player). I personally have enjoyed my f nen all the way through (currently sitting at 82), it helps a lot early on to supplement with sand splash and low kick, converting them to magic damage with the conversion option."
"Thanks to the despicable Judge Stephen Williams for explaining why our system of law is dog shit and our system of checks and balances is horribly broken in this document.

&gt;One judge in Friday’s appellate ruling went so far as to defend the NSA’s right not to reveal whether a plaintiff had actually been spied on or not. “Plaintiffs complain that the government should not be allowed to avoid liability simply by keeping the material classified,” wrote Stephen Williams. “But the government’s silence regarding the scope of bulk collection is a feature of the program, not a bug.”

Which should bring to mind an older, relevant document.

&gt;We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.--That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, --That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But **when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security.**"

The information could be presented in the relevant location but those who want a purely watsonian argument don't have to be interrupted with it. Also there is no logical reason to ban meta discussion involving multiple settings. Again that leads to great discussions. Being a mod you can either work with the community or for yourself.

"It's true that vaccines aren't 100%.  No medication or medical procedure is 100% safe.  There is a risk that some people's bodies will ""overreact"", similar to an allergic reaction.  It's extremely rare, but it is a risk.  There is also a slight risk if the vaccine was stored improperly and bacteria infected the vile (this happens more frequently today because anti-vaxx advocates pushed for eliminating preservatives from vaccines because of misinformation about the preservatives on the internet, particularly thimerosal).

&gt; Lastly, doctors are not scientific leaders. They take the position of being told what to do and are, from day one, under the control of the drug manufactures.

It's not just doctors that agree vaccines are safe, it's the entire scientific community, because the scientific evidence is overwhelming and there has never been a scientifically verified reproducible study that has shown there is a significant danger to any vaccine in use today.  Period.

Millions of people take vaccines, and people who take vaccines are no more likely to develop any type of condition than those who don't."

"I am testing the mods atm, will post my impressions here.

1. The armor plates mod seems balanced to me, not overpowered.

2. Azimuth's oxygen generators are 1x1x1, this is almost OP. I'd rather had them 1x1x2. Haven't tested the tank volume and the oxy generator performance yet.

3. I tested this wake bomb and fell in love with it. It's requires completely different approah to bombing, as well as skill and luck. Not OP but fun as hell. https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=354194728

4. Azimuth batteries are, in my opinion, OP, as well as their ""fusion"" reactors. Totally destroys the balance, irregardless of the resourse cost.

5. The ""armored"" thrusters look much better, provide the same amount of thrust, and the additional ""armor"" is almost non-existent. Can take a couple more gatling bullets, so not OP, but look much better and should make it into vanilla game. **Large ship armored thrusters require to be adjusted to the latest vanilla game rebalance!**

6. RCS thrusters are very good, should be in vanilla game too. Excellent for precise docking maneuvers, useless for anything else.

7. Accumulators and capacitors are great and seem balanced to me! Accumulators work like batteries that can store more energy, but their output is weaker. Could be great for storing solar energy in bases and large ships. Capacitors are the opposite: very low storage, but can provide big current, thus compensating for intermittent overloads. I checked the storage and output values vs battery volume. The 1x1x1 mini battery is fine, but the slim battery is a little underpowered and needs to be adjusted.

8. Afterburner is a very interesting concept, although, the implementation could be better. I'd like to have those in the game, and I even considered making a similar mod myself, but there is already an existing one.

9. The solar batteries mod I suggested includes centered panels as well. I checked the power output vs surface vs the vanilla panels. Big ships panels provide exactly the same power/surface area, and the small ship panels are just slightly less efficient.

"If your energy is effected that severely, your daily calories are probably below your [Basal Metabolic Rate](http://www.myfitnesspal.com/tools/bmr-calculator). 


1. My BMR is 2064 cal/day, and I want to loose about 1.5 lb/week. 
2. I calculated my TDEE as 2477 (1.2 x BMR) since my job is sedentary. 
3. Now I want to lose 1.5 lb/week (1.5 lb/wk * 3500 lb/cal = 5250 cal/wk), but if I cut my diet by 750 (5250/7) cals/day to 1727 cal/day, I'd be below my BMR and very lethargic (like you describe). 
4. Instead I do about 2500 cal/wk of cardio and cut my diet to 2080 cal/day, just above my BMR.
5. My net calories per week is something like: (Food - TDEE) * 7 - Cardio = Deficit (2080-2477)*7-2500 = -5279 (close enough to my goal of 5250)

Hope this all makes sense! Let me know if you'd like another example with your numbers?

"&gt; I'm a pro-lifer and I don't consider myself a social conservative.

Well that's fine and dandy that you don't consider yourself one; you *do* hold a social conservative view on at least one issue.

"The ONDP targeted their messaging at blue-collar non-Toronto Ontario. The OLP successfully painted that as a move to the right, and continually claimed that they had produced the most progressive budget in history.

That's why the ONDP kept their vote and seat totals basically even, while seeing it shift away from Toronto. That's why people like Jonah Schein lost their seats. (Tellingly, it was the MPPs with unimpeachable leftist bona fides who survived, like Cheri DiNovo.)

The subsequent programme of the Liberals in government, however, has been radically neoliberal, stepping up attacks on unions and kicking the pace of privatisations into high gear. Anyone gullible enough to believe the hype about the OLP's supposed outlefting the ONDP has has learned the error oh their ways, and I don't think they're gonna fall for it this time when Trudeau tries it."

"Because a Google search for how to do Aetherial Reduction lead me here only to tell me ""Hey! you should do that thing you're trying to figure out how to do! gl buddy!"" ...Not OP's fault, but in case anyone else ran into this frustration...

Here's how you do it:

1. Find an ephemeral node. I farm furrymints in Twinpools W. Coerthas from 12a - 4a for example, but they're on a timer all over the new areas. [There's probably a guide somewhere.](http://ffxiv.consolegameswiki.com/wiki/Ephemeral_Nodes)

2. Switch on the Collector's Glove action before digging/hacking. It's in your actions list.. the hand by the square/pyramid thingy. It's a permanent thing that stays on.

3. Here's where I was getting confused. Click your furrymint or whatever and it will go to a screen with a 30/30 and it won't let you do jack (which was the point I started doing Google searches and found this thing about how awesome the thing I can't do is)

4. Don't do what I did instead do this.

5. Hit the skill Discerning Eye. Why? Still don't know. Just do it.

6. Now you can hit Utmost Caution skill and maybe some other stuff... again I still don't know what's going on, but it works :p

7. After hitting these cool skills you've had for 2 months without a clue as to what they did you can use ""Methodical Appraiser"" --which is the gather this stuff skill. You'll get something collectible woohoo.

8. Repeat that stuff till the node is empty. 

9. Go to your items, and now those collectibles will give you the option to Aetherial Reduce them.

I know nothing about how to get the best stuff, what the actions do, but it's a start, and it's better than yelling at Google for taking you here for an hour. gl."

"That's a very well explained post, here you have my upvote, fellow colleague. 

Just to clear some things up, I tried to express in the PS that I don't mean every single one of us nor every single legitimate complaint; in fact I said in the first paragraph that I understand them and of course there are things that could be better. My limited english only allows me to explain myself up to a certain point, but the overall point is we are overreacting as a whole, at average, even though there are legitimate complaints and things that could (and should) be fixed/changed.  

And even though some changes were made towards more expending or more time consuming, I think that overall they are giving us much more than they ""took"" from us. We got lots of covers to collect and we complain we can't get them all. We got new modes and we complain they are too time consuming. We got new heroes and we complain we can get them easy. We got new costumes and we complain they won't be there forever. I think you can see the pattern.

Also, sometimes we can't stop believing we have the right to have it all or win it all; I wouldn't expect the game to allow me to be #1 in Battleworld with a team of 4* by only pairing me with teams like mine, the same way people don't expect to compete in real life only with same-category people instead of the whole spectrum (i.e. entering in a top university with a low SAT grade; if you don't have top grades you don't go to top places, I think it's fair). I'm sure the matchmaking could be fixed, but at some point you should be paired with teams better than yours in order to hit a ""wall"" at your class. Btw with 60 wins I'm in the top 5000 for the reward, close to the end, so it's not THAT time consuming I'd say. And then again, it's not like you'll miss a big reward, it's more like ""voluntary"". 

Thank you for your two cents :) I think that we can meet each other in the middle after all ;)"

Unless you're the second coming of the greatest Magic player ever, after playing for a month you have absolutely no clue why certain cards should be in what slot, what the tricks and interactions between cards are, what interactions exist, when it's optimal to play something, when to hold priority to respond to a trigger.

There's so much to it that you're basically jumping into the deep end, because being the person who actually designs the cube really requires and understanding that's a step beyond just understanding how to draft, it's needing to understand how the entire system works together.

"I used to think *Fahrenheit 451* was about censorship too, but recently I learned that it's actually a warning about how TV will make people forget about the written word, and now that I think about it, that's exactly what happened in the book: people chose to get rid of books in favor of TV walls."
"I know exactly how you feel. I want to be able to be open about it so bad, but I live in Louisiana. Which is pretty much one of the worst places to be open about it considering we don't even have decent medicinal laws. (Oil only and for very few conditions) If I was in a state like Colorado I'd have no problem with it. The fact that you're working for a place that receives federal funding really complicates things I feel. It's admirable and right that you'd feel this way, but it's probably for the best that you keep it on the down low for the next year at least. "
"Those ""23 steps"" are only needed in case of a market outage, which is very rare. In all other cases, finalizing is as easy as it was on Agora. So it's a win-win here, if the market is up everything goes smoothly, if the market is down you can still get your coins (unlike centralized escrow)

Also, it is more like 6 steps of copy-pasting, not 23. You know, Ctrl+C and Ctrl+V. That thing we all learned how to do in the third grade. If a vendor is too lazy to learn how to Ctrl+C, Ctrl+V coins to himself, and would rather have his coins under the control of the market who can exit at any time, then that is his decision.

Additionally, it's difficult to arbitrarily lose your coins in this process, as the console will give you a nice little error notice in red if you screw up Ctrl+C/Ctrl+V'ing something. It's not like your coins will go into oblivion.

Btw, timelocking a 2-of-2? ""Vendors can exit scam with escrow""? You sound like a dumbass... Unless you're trolling, which, congratulations, that is some very good bait"
"Ramos is a decent defender behind the plate.

Gio was sucking even with Lobaton.  Anyways, correlation does not equal causation.

Matt has been alright, considering what he's been given.  He's still a below average manager and he for sure fucked up the series in New York last month."
"I'm definitely considering that scenario and that's why I would link my movement skill to blood magic. Also, ew, that heart and soul cluster. I would feel dirty taking hybrid life/mana nodes when using EB. But I guess it can't be helped."
"Personally, I would prefer this to be an inclusive place for anyone that would like to mock, discuss and document the decay of our capitalist societies.

I would also prefer it to be based in post about real events occuring in the world, new and old, that speaks to that theme. I don't think memes themselves should be featured here, unless they manifest in real life on their own. 

But, I'm not intending to be a despot and I want to hear your ideas. As this is a very new sub I think setting the direction we want earliy and in agreeance with the users we have at this point is key. So please share your ideas and any suggestions. 

At the same time, I don't think it should be a super-serious-all-the-time place either. I would like it to be grounded in real events. With the occasional zesty meme. "
"&gt; Comet storm killing 2 2/1s = RR{1} + 2 kickers, so RR[3].

For Comet Storm to kill 2 X/1's, it only needs to be kicked once, for RR[2]. You get one target just for casting the spell normally. In fact, for killing any number of X/1's, Comet Storm will cost the same as Rolling Thunder.  Comet Storm comes out ahead when you want to deal more than one damage to multiple targets."
"With respect, I think you're putting way too much interpretation in the comments from the story.

I mean, we don't need actual force for rape - if you're passed out of otherwise unable to give consent you can't consent.  Yes, we're being fucked in this in the both drunk, or ""she had one drink"" type bullshit, but rape is the absence of consent for sex...easy and simple.

The prosecutor's comment isn't supportive of changing one's mind after the fact - their prosecution hinged on whether or not she went to the party to have sex, she could still choose to not consent when the situation actually presents itself.  I see no argument that she should be able to change her mind after the fact.

And of course the parents of the little snowflake are going to stand up for their little snowflake.  They're not going to come out an issue a statement telling the world their daughter is a stupid bitch for even going, or wanting to fuck before the party.  Its irrelevant to the story, because every parent will act like that if they believe their snowflake was actually raped.

I do think that this guy probably got fucked by the system (shocking, I know) - but realistically, many of your complaints about the story otherwise seem unfounded.  Just my two cents."
"I second FTL. You'll love it. Guaranteed.

I'd also recommend 'No More Room in Hell' - it's a free Source engine title about survivng from zombies. Despite it's mixed rep, I love it. There's no P2W at all, and it's great for a laugh with a few friends. I regularly return to it with a friend, and it's just great banter.

Not sure if it's considered 'mainstream', but I'd highly recommend the original Metro 2033 if you can get your hands on it (Humble Bundle usually give it away free every year or so). Stellar story, gameplay, and a great title to burn through and enjoy. They released 'Metro Redux', which is 2033 remastered and it's sequel Last Light in a bundle pack. I haven't played the Redux version of 2033 other than a quick jam because I bought the bundle for LL Redux, but they've changed it up too much for my liking. Metro Last Light Redux is fine as there's not much in the way of remastering given it was released so close to the Redux-ing."
"Back in the 90s I remember listening to The City Sleeps by MC 900 Foot Jesus, while driving on a windy forested road at night. Definitely have me goosebumps. Maybe a bit cheesy now but I still dig it. 

Also, I wrote it in another comment, the album Maxinquaye by Tricky fits your requirements exactly. From the opening drum. It's eerie dark and beautiful. "
"Who in the Hell did Bobby Jindal think he was by attempting to dictate what ANY President addresses in their speeches?  He needs to know his place in this country.  Governors do NOT dictate to any U.S. President.  

President Obama was correct to ignore Jindal's request given the damage that climate change has inflicted upon Lousianna, particularly New Orleans."
"If you are connected to the repeater you will experience a drop in speed about 50%.  You'll probably also interfere with other networks around you so as well which will also hurt the quality of the connection. But the upside is that you will have a connection in your room.

You can always try buying you own router and see how that works out. I'd recommend something of quality if you are in a super-congested area (which sounds like you are). Buy something like an ASUS RT-AC66U, put your current modem into bridge mode, and connect the router to that. With some high-quality Ethernet cable that is long enough you should be able to move the router to a more favorable position and have a better signal overall."
"I don't have *that* much of an issue with them, other than the fact that they are apparently buff albino handsome Squidwards... I away saw them as abstract elephantine biomechanoids, like how Giger designed them. 


But I do like how they created the xenos, I always though the xenos were artificial in origin."
"That's what I don't understand. You know that all you have to do is stand behind minions to not get grabbed and yet you still just stand in the open and let Blitz pull you under tower and then complain that he's OP.

I know a lot of times people in low elo are making mistakes like that because they don't know what to do, or they don't know how to deal with a certain ability or champion, but when you know what you're supposed to do (which it seems everyone does with Blitz) and then you still don't do it I just don't understand that."
"Fritz 13 is funny when you play it. ''So das ware die schach.''

I use scid vs PC and load houdini 1.5 on it. It's simple, easy to use for when I want to follow a top game to see whats going on when my frail mind can't handle it."
"Personally, I use after effects.  Don't quote me on it, but I was under the impression that flash is a vector-based animation program.  I used AE because it's an animation and compositing program that works with vectors, rasters, and is built to be friendly with 3D programs.  I know nothing about toonboom."
"For gaming, and particularly MS FSX, you want a stronger CPU. Intel is more recommended for what you're doing. Also 8gb of RAM is more than enough for a gaming machine right now.

I swapped some parts out for others that are faster, higher quality and better for the money.

"My interpretation: Gom Jabbar is an ancient non-Latin incantation in HPMORverse which Draco just happened to have researched in old dark tomes, and far predates the writings we're familiar with. 

Frank Herbert somehow picked up on the phrase, either overhearing it in passing or perhaps by having some actual knowledge of the magical world (e.g. magical relative or somesuch)."
"We do need to significantly decrease the amount of lords. Or find a new way of appointing them. I've always favoured the idea that professional bodies could nominate their own representatives (ie: the General Medical Council, the Royal Society, Institution of Engineering and Technology, various charities, even the Conservative and Labour Parties themselves for political lords.) to hold a position in the House. So they're real technocrats with years of experience that are willing to represent both the interests and knowledge of their organisations in a legislative capacity.

Bit of a pipe dream, though."
"A jumper at my DZ landed herself in a coma with brain damage during an out landing.  It was definitely due to an unforced error on her part, and landing out is something you should always be prepared for cause sometimes it *is* the better option, but lets not pretend like there's never anything to it."
"Makes me sick when I see people say Anti Vaxxer's are an example of ""Natural Selection"" and they deserve it. No one deserves to have their kids paralyzed from polio. This website's top comments show that no one cares about trying to get anti vaxxers informed or preventing disease. they just want to be intellectually superior and mock."

"i don't need to re-read your comment where you misunderstand the proposition and suggest that it would be *less* confusing to provide a completely separate keybind that duplicates the function of something that could be handled by one key with a 3rd option. i already read that stupidity and understood how wildly off base you were - that's why i stepped in to call you insane.

your solution is to provide ANOTHER ball cam key... lol. PSYONIX PLS HIRE THIS GUY FOR GREAT CROSS PLATFORM UI/UX."
"From the male side. Dating another INTJ is a very unique proposition. Being with a woman you can respect for her brain and character is something not many men get to experience. There is immediate understanding, ability to work through issues with nearly no effort, and discussions almost always end with the satisfaction of having found a solution.

There are only 3 things to check, from my experience and reading comments here and elsewhere: 

(a) are both people mature enough to enjoy investing in the relationship and dedicating it some time? If not it will fizzle out.
(b) are both people stable (i.e. no personality disorders)? - INTJ life is hard, many of us carry baggage which can be destabilizing; baggage which is transparent until the moment one gets into an intimate situation with another person and there are feelings on the line.
(c) is there limbic system attraction and can it be sustained. This involves both taking care of the looks department (very hard when you are in the middle of a project) and also just having some traits particular to your gender that keep the lower brain layers of the other person ""on board"" with the plan. Possibly in (c) there is a lot of variability, going from people who couldn't care less about anything other than intelligence (mostly INTP-land), to people who want a more complete package (towards ENTJ land). "
"The Seattle Opera has these.  They're at the back of the upper balcony so the view isn't great, but the speakers mean you can at least hear just fine, but no one can hear you.

I know this because if you feel sick they'll let you use them as well, especially since very few people bring kids to the opera in the first place.  That way you can cough or moan and not bother people who paid $600 for their seats or what-have-you."
"&gt; They did it without paywalls and also without excessive tracking and advertisements.
&gt;

&gt; Then Google came in

Youtube did not have advertising (or even revenue) until *after* google bought it. They were a startup quickly burning through cash, and google bought them for the audience and tried to make it sustainable. "
"I'm not sure - I only know that a while back I tried to link to the Express (to point out how terrible it was) and my comment was auto-deleted. Which is probably why this post links to an archived version, rather than the page itself."
"It will likely go on to your final destination.

If you bag arrives in the final destination airport before you,  it will be in baggage claim then put back somewhere.  You'll need to claim it though an office.  "
"H blademaster is generally pretty bad for assa, I'd suggest grabbing normal class trinket/ heroic censer if those are available to you. Now that you have 4set, your uptime on envenom should be extremely high, specially during execute phase, so you'll definetly see a significant increase in dps on certain fights (gorefiend, tyrant, etc.). 
Now, to the logs: On the reaver kill your popped your CDs before bloodlust. Again, I've said this today, this is only a small dps loss for rogues compared to other classes but it is still a dps loss. I do however believe this was due to lust being popped late and not you misplaying, but do keep this in mind. 
About combat, I do suggest using blade master + soul cap on iskar and xhul like i said a couple comments earlier, tho I'd use soul cap + class on advanced trash. I wouldn't play combat on council, specially considering your OS is assa, which is even better than sub for council. Combat is probably the worst spec, it's all ""fluff"" damage since gurtogg is the real prio. Hope it was useful advice, your logs look solid overall. 
"
"That's the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard. I don't care about the aim assist but holy crap I like to play on high sensitivity so I can have an advantage on other players but I can't do that when this bull shit sniper scope moves around so damn fast. "
"Dragon Quest VI... It's okay. I've been marathoning the DQ series for the first time, and was really excited to get to VI since it brought back the vocation system. I'm having fun mixing abilities onto characters...but the story so far has been utterly boring and confusing. None of the characters are very interesting either. Coming off of V, this is a big let down. Otherwise, I'm still kinda having fun exploring stuff and I think that's what DQ does best; gives you a semi-open world to explore.

Xenoblade Chronicles (Wii)... I've needed to play it for a long time and I'm finally making my way through it. I really want to give this game a 10/10 because of the spectacle of it all; it can be breathtaking...but I can't. The story is a bit slow right now though I'm positive it'll get better. The characters seem pretty cool. But the gameplay...it feels like there's way too many systems going on. Affinity with NPCs, Affinity (coins?) with party members, Skill links, Party Gauge, Chains, Gem creation, random items scattered all over the ground for idk what reason, getting equipment drops with totally different stats and some being slotted or perma-slotted, weird targeting system, the whole random ""Press B for a morale boost, whatever that does!"" in battle... it feels like it's too much yet none of it totally goes over my head so I'm still enjoying it all. Also Gaur Plains theme is probably the best video game song ever made."
"Either way there's gender disparities, gender issues involved. Predicated on the fact women feel the need to be more attentive since they fear/will be seen as less than they are (even unconsciously) and guys who feel it's not masculine, that it's weak (so, feminine) of them to *have* emotional and mental health problems. "
"I still can't play a single game without the game crashing. I can't even alt-tab after that and have to either restart the pc or use Win + R to use taskkill (completely blind because i just see a black screen). 

Also the input lag is horrible and somehow my settings are always reset when i start the game (when it crashes + when i close it normally). So i also have to set everything to reduce the stupid input lag...

I have no idea how the XB and PC beta are so horrible after the really good PS4 beta...

Specs: I5-4590, R9 390, 8GB RAM, Win 10 Professional"
"As someone who introduced it to my GF, I'd recommend taking it at her pace. Dota2 can be overwhelming, because there's so much to learn. Let her do the tutorials, watch the vids (just youtube it, there's some great ones), watch the International with her, with commentary. They're great to explain, rewind and explain. GL"
"Even stopping to take photos, sightseeing along the way, keeping up a conversation with a friend. I'd be bored as fuck doing it for that long. At my slowest dawdle I walk at 3 miles an hour. Slowing down beyond that I just can't fathom. "
"Well, considering that even a diamond can be broken with a head-on collision with a bullet, the homeworld likely couldn't fight earth's armies head-on.
If the homeworld had tanks or artillery, or something of that sort, pack your bags."
"&gt; bringing it up just comes off as a stab against AJ

Because at this point this is the only thing WWE cares about. They've always been petty when it comes to bad terms with former employees. They would never acknowledge AJ and use her time with the company and her friendship with Paige on a storyline."
"http://imgur.com/QIeXtFD.jpg
I'm not trying to be greedy or anything but winning this would be nice. My specs are kinda shit tier but decent with an i5-2300, GTX 750 Ti and 8 gigs of RAM(couldn't download anymore ram). Sorry for the crusty pic and dusty pc but anyway thanks for the giveaway/congrats to whoever wins if I don't."
"Entitlement is a bitch huh. Poor people probably feel like they have a right to the contents of my savings account and retirement fund too.

After all it's fucking bullshit that I'm just leaving that money sitting there unspend."
"I don't mind thinking through an at-bat. David Cone does it on YES often, but seemingly every other sentence from Curt's mouth begins with *I*. We know you were a pitcher, Curt.     
He can discuss pitch sequences, locations and the like without constantly reminding us that he used to play the game.

"&gt; Ironically I'm raised eastern and western, so I've grown up with an amount of fan service as you'd expect, but I notice it more and more the past 5-6 years than ever before because its somewhat exploded into popularity.

It seems we have similar backgrounds from that standpoint.

&gt;I think we hit a good middle ground honestly. Its not often on reddit you can discuss something without hurling abuse about

Completely agree. Great talking to you, and good luck on whatever development project you got going. "
"Full casters. I'm a huge fan of glass cannons and the like. As such, I prefer Sorcerers, Wizards, Warlocks, etc. and all their prestige and alternate-type classes. I grew up playing these types of games with my dad, who was either a paladin, big-ass fighter, or barbarian, so he always wanted a ranged fighter to help deal damage, and I always liked magic over physical prowess. 

This being said, I've been looking into Kineticist, so we'll see if I change a bit. "
"My game installed very quickly, that white bar before you even start the game you see in the PS menu. Yes because I figured the online servers are not online yet seeing as the game should not be out yet."
"At the risk of sounding like an asshole, isn't that kind of the point of having a new generation? Support for previous gens has to stop at some point. Can't really advance in the industry if you're still concerned with older technology.

Mortal Kombat 9 is on PS3/360. If you own an older system you have to get used to playing older games."
"That's kind of a weird song to defen. I mean, they literally said they hated generic pop (not that I don't love that song, but it isn't what most people who consider an example of ""the musical decline"")"
"Hmm, this may be a bit risky, but you could buy all the stuff first and then conduct a session with potential members. Then if they like the session and want to join the club, charge a membership fee. I don't know the college club that doesn't have a member fee. Usually like 15 dollars"
"Is there a UserVoice suggestion for it? If not, there should be. If we could get the votes of all the people who come to this sub, it would definitely make an impact. Now, I could create one and link to it here, but I don't want it to come off as some kind of voting scheme or anything."
"I couldn't agree more with your armor suggestions. Btw I am a huge fan of Army of One of the shotgun. So many times I have gotten a kill to juice my grenade recharge just in time for either a post-mortem or at the very least clutch chain damage.

edit: completely skipped over subclass design sections.... good work."

Once realized, we didn't let her have them alone, but N only escalated abuse towards the family, and eventually chaos ensued.  If I had realized when they were babies that N was still N-ing at others, I would not have let her near them.   I wish I had.

We raise ""family"" relationships to almost holiness in this country.  If it is a good family, yes, have relationships with them.  But if what they are going to teach your child is that the child is worthless, or to be selfish pigs like N, or any other nastiness, then RUN AWAY.  "

"The thing that made it easier for me was to only cast SoF when you know that it will activate immediately.  Meaning, only click to cast it when you're in range.

If you do that, then right after you click, press Q.  You can practice against bots and stuff, it's important to be able to do, so just keep at it and you'll get it.  

I've never tried quick cast, I seeing the targeting circle is very important to me, so I don't think that would help."

"Warlocks definitely got shafted too, it's just not as bad overall because  warlock has multiple viable playstyles that will probably continue to be fine.  Definitely garbage for the most part though.  Honestly they really need to get WAY better at balancing warlock card power vs. drawbacks.  Wrathguard is just absurdly bad, that massive drawback in exchange for what exactly?  4/3 isn't even good stats.  Not to mention Demonfuse, jesus.  For the expansion itself warlock may very well have gotten the worst cards out of anyone.  At least rogue got some moderately interesting ones like beneath the grounds, burgle, and anub, and also got a pretty nice boost in arena.  Warlocks really just got absolutely nothing."

"**LIBERATION SPOILERS!!!** Spain in the 1500's  is full of expiration. Cortes, de Gama, etc. Since the movie's time period is **prior** to the exploration, I almost feel like we are going to get a set up for the exploration and conquest of Mexico and Peru. Remember, the Templar are looking for POE and temples, and where do we find a crap ton of literal temples? Central America! That's right, those of you playing at home, what if this movie is going to be ground work for a second movie to take us to central America to explore/destroy those temples? We know from Liberation that the Templar are excavating a Mayan temple in Mexico to find POE, so something has to push them in that direction, right? "

That was until one friend started building one. Before, I had tried to play Skyrim on a terrible laptop to get mods because Skyrim was my all-time favorite game. Even when he got his PC, I thought PC gaming was too expensive. However, I eventually caved. I found a prebuilt ASUS at Best Buy and picked it up. That was a huge regret. However, it has done its job and I will upgrade it soon. Now, all of my friends play PC mostly. But the best part of playing PC is playing Skyrim with mods. Skyrim was already my favorite game, but now its even better.

"**Tired of League and wanna try out Dota 2? You just took the first step for a better gaming experience!**

**Here a short^^Kappa list of things you need to know.**

&amp;nbsp;
***
### Avoid using League of Legends Terminology

* **Dota 2 is not a ""MOBA""** (CS:GO best ""MOBA"")
* Dota 2 is officially an ""ARTS"" 
* ""Hero"" not ""Champion""
* ""Tower"" not ""Turret""
* ""Creep"" not ""Minion""
* ""Barracks"" not ""Inhibitor""
* ""Ancient"" not ""Nexus"" (Wc3 = Tree and Throne)
* ""Roshan"" not ""Baron"" or ""Nashor""
* ""MMR"" not ""Elo"" (No, it's not the same. Elo = name of the ranking system named after it's creator, MMR = meaning of the shown value ""Match Making Rating"".)

Explanation why Dota 2 is not a ""MOBA"":

* DotA was made on Warcraft III which is an RTS game. Since DotA is basically a modified RTS game the genre was specified based on the genre of the original game, thus making it an ARTS. This is the logical name for it with a clear description and meaning behind it.
* The term ARTS was used before ""MOBA"" was even heard of, but wasn't used as much because DotA was the only game of this kind.
* Why ""MOBA"" doesn't even fit as a genre name: *What competitive game isn't multiplayer, online, and takes on some sort of battle? The first three words apply to nearly every single online game that pits players against each other (obviously). The fourth word, arena, doesn't even describe the DotA/LoL/HoN-genre. Using that word implies an all-hostile area that dismisses the territorial control and lane-pushing among its many facets of gameplay.*

&amp;nbsp;
***
### Before learning Dota 2

* Your rank in LoL doesn't matter when playing Dota 2.
* Don't apply your League habits to Dota 2.
* Be open for everything, there is more than one way to play.
* Your Dota 2 level does not matter and does not reflect your skill.

&amp;nbsp;
***
### General Information

* Every hero is available for everyone. (Different game modes might restrict which hero you can pick.)
* You have a courier which can bring items to you.
* Item's can be dropped, stashed, and some of them can be shared to other players.
* Compared to League, Dota 2 has many activatable items, most of them for utility purpose. 
* You lose gold when you die.
* All units have a turn rate. If you want to turn around with your hero you have to turn first before actually moving. It feels weird at first, but it's really easy to get used to.
* Micro - You move other units by selecting the units you want to move and not by Alt-click like in LoL. Meaning you can also deselect your hero unlike in LoL where your Champ is always selected.
* Mana management is very important. Spells costs way more than in LoL, but they have also a bigger impact when used correctly.

&amp;nbsp;
***
### Denying Mechanic

* You can deny your own/allied units with an attack command (A-click).
* You can deny creeps (&lt;50% HP) to reduce the exp the enemy gets and obviously denying potential gold.
* You can deny heroes (&lt;25% HP) who have certain damage over time spells/debuffs on them.
* You can deny towers (&lt;10% HP) to reduce the gold the enemy team receives.

&amp;nbsp;
***
### Runes

* Runes are special boosters which give you a certain effect depending on which rune you pick up.
* Runes spawn every 2 minutes on 2 locations on the river.
* There is always a Bounty rune and 1 random non-bounty rune. (Except for game start there are 2 Bounty Runes.)
* No non-bounty rune can spawn twice in a row.
* If a rune is not taken on a 2 minute mark, the rune will change.
* Runes can be stored inside of a Bottle and activated at will for up to 2 minutes before they activate automatically.
* After the rune is being from a Bottle, the Bottle will be refilled with 3 charges.

*The Runes:*

* **Bounty** - Gives 50 + (5 * minute) experience and 50 + (2 * minute) unreliable gold.
* **Double Damage** - Increases base attack damage by 100% for 45 seconds.
* **Haste** - Increases movement speed to 522 for 25 seconds and ignores all slow effects. Can be purged.
* **Illusion** - Spawns 2 illusions that last 75 seconds, and deal 35% damage. Melee take 200% damage, ranged take 300% damage.
* **Invisibility** - Grants invisibility after a 2 second fade time. Lasts 45 seconds.
* **Regeneration** - Grants 100 health regeneration and 67 mana regeneration per second for 30 seconds. Effect ends if hero takes damage, or when both health and mana are fully replenished.

&amp;nbsp;
***
### Day/Night Cycle

* Game starts at 0:00 as day time, prior to that it's also day time.
* Every 4 minutes the game time changes (first night at 4:00).
* The game time affects the hero/creeps/building vision.
* Heroes have regular 1800 day vision and 800 night vision. There are exceptions.
* There are spells which affect the game time.
* Moon Shard grants you +250 night vision.
* Aghanim's Scepter for Keeper of the Light will give him unobstructed vision at day while Night Stalker gets unobstructed vision at night.


&amp;nbsp;
***
### Tower Aggro

*Target Priority in descending order:*

* Closest enemy unit or hero attacking a friendly hero with auto attack
* Closest enemy unit or hero attacking the tower itself with auto attack
* Closest enemy unit or hero attacking any friendly unit with auto attack
* Closest enemy unit
* Closest enemy hero
* Closest enemy catapult

*Circumstances for target switch:*

* If the targeted enemy unit or hero goes out of range
* If the targeted enemy unit or hero dies
* If an enemy unit or hero targets a friendly hero
* If an enemy hero being attacked by the tower manually attacks another enemy unit or hero (in which case, the tower will select a new target based on the above priority order).

&amp;nbsp;
***
### Creep Aggro

*Target Priority in descending order:*

* Closest enemy lane creeps
* Closest enemy hero
* Closest enemy catapult

*Other behavior:*

* Ordering an attack on an enemy hero will change their aggro onto you.
* Lane creeps can follow you anywhere until they lose sight for a longer time or take aggro by other lane or neutral creeps.

&amp;nbsp;
***
### Gameplay
